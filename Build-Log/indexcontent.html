		<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p>For my Hardware project, I decided to work on the Parts Crib database. With all of the knowledge I have acquired in 
		my previous courses, I believe I have the skills to properly design and program a piece of hardware that will work in 
		conjunction with a smartphone/tablet application. The main purpose is to bring a more efficient and advanced experience 
		between students and employees. Right now the parts crib is using paper and pen to sign in/out equipment along with 
		leaving your student ID. With our hardware we plan to modernize the experience by scanning in each student’s library 
		barcode to identify students and scanning QR codes to identify parts and link the rented equipment with the student 
		barcode ID in our network database. The database will also collectively produce data that can be used to help identify 
		higher demands for certain items and also help track lost inventory. My project team mates are Masoud Rahguzar, 
		Divesh Oree and Rafil Yashooa.

		<p>The webcam will be used to scan ID barcodes and item QR codes to register the parts with students. 
		The codes will then be processed by the raspberry pi. Once everything is processed the Pi will upload the info to 
		the database which can then be accessed through a mobile app for a better visual experience.

		<H3>Bill of Materials/Budget</H3>
		<p>
		<p>The parts needed for this project are listed below along with how much they cost and where you can go to buy them. Things
		such as the PCB and Acrylic box was provided by the school but there are a lot of places you can go to aquire them such as hobby shops
		and electronic shops. Our total budget for phase 1 (first half) was $200.00 and listed below you'll see we managed to stay within our
		budget.</p>

		<H3>Time Commitment</H3>
		<p>The time committed to complete the project was 15 weeks as listed in the project schedule but with the instructions 
		provided it could be reproduced in less than a week if parts arrive in a time. The first week consisted of creating our 
		online web template website via github and learning the basics of how to use it. By week 2 the project proposal had been 
		completed and ready to submit. Week 3 consisted of figuring out my team mates and working on the project schedule. 
		On week 4 the budget report had been completed and submitted and the order for parts had been placed. By week 5 I had 
		received my parts and was on my way to assembling while working on completing and testing my PCB. Week 6 I had complete 
		the mechanical assembly of my project and was ready to start researching the software portion of the hardware. Week 7 was 
		the first time I had powered up and put together my parts along with peer grading the other students to ensure everyone 
		was on schedule. I began testing different methods for scanning barcodes and came across a great tool call Zbar which can 
		be found online. Week 8 we had completed the Placard for our assignment which can be found <a href="/Documentation/placard.jpg">here.</a> I also began 
		working on my build video for week 9. Week 10 we had to demonstrate the functionality of our hardware. In the following 
		weeks I began to improve the software to better scan barcodes with a higher success rate. By week 13 my project was 
		completed and my presentation was done to show its functionality and purpose. Listed below is a table that shows how much 
		time it would take to build the project if one were to follow these build instructions.</p>

		<H3>Mechanical Assembly</H3>
		<p>The assembly of my project is quite simple. The webcam connects to the raspberry pi through the USB connector. 
		The PCB is then connected to the 40 pin connector on top of the raspberry pi. Also connect the HDMI to a monitor for 
		viewing and connected a power source to the Pi.

			<H3>PCB / Soldering</H3>
			<p>The PCB contains resistors, capacitors, transistors, an LED, 2 four pin headers and a 5 pin header. All of these components 
			were soldered together using non led based solder and took about an hour to properly solder everything without any errors. 
			It is best to take your time and fill the entire circular area on the board with enough but not too much solder.

		<H3>Software Setup</H3>
		<P>
Start by assembling the raspberry pi into its casing. Once all assembled make sure to have your HDMI cable connected first along with a keyboard and mouse. 
Before powering up your Raspberry Pi make sure your SD card has the appropriate operating system. You can visit Raspberrypi.org to download the free operating system and the instructions on how to install on an SD card. 
Once that is finished, insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect the micro USB power adaptor. The unit will take a few minutes for its first time boot.
Once you have powered up make sure to open up the terminal and run:
			<pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
			<pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code></pre>
This will ensure that you have updated to the latest firmware and drivers.Next download Necessary software.
Start by installing the webcam driver by running:
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install fswebcam</code></pre>
Next you’ll need to install python, zbar library and pillow by running:
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-dev</code></pre>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-pip</code></pre>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-pip</code></pre>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-httplib2</code></pre>
Once all that is installed and downloaded you’ll need to download the zbar library from the official <a href="https://github.com/npinchot/zbar"> Github account</a> and export the files into a single folder. Once downloaded run:
<pre><code>python setup.py install –user </code></pre>
This will install the appropriate files and will be done automatically once the command runs. Then download the code listed below and run:
<pre><code>gcc –Wall –o executable name c_file.c – lwiringPi"</code></pre>
 Once that code is compiled run the executable name that you chose for the program and youll be able to scan barcodes and view them in a file called student_numbers

		<H3>Unit Testing</H3>
		<p>The unit testing is always the first thing that should be done in order to ensure the reliability of the hardware. 
		The PCB was the main board we needed to test since it was the only one that had been soldered by us. Most of our hardware 
		was pre-built and needed to just be connected together. I was able to successfully test my PCB in the prototype lab with Vlad 
		and all the components were working fine with no shorts or fixes required.</p>
		
		</SECTION>

		<SECTION ID="Section_8">
		<H3>Production Testing</H3>
		<p>Production testing can be done by running each individual code by itself to ensure each component is working. The webcam can
			be tested by taking screen shots and checking the output file to see if the webcam is able to see anything.</p>
		
		
		</SECTION>
	<SECTION ID="Section_9">
		<H3>Project Reproducible ?</H3>
		<p>Yes, I believe once following these build instructions one can easily reproduce this project in a matter of a week’s time. </p>
