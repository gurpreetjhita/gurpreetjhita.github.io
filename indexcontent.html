	Week 11: Today I was given feedback about my hardware demonstration from Mr. Medri, he gave us some excellent feedback about our 
	hardware. Things such as programming an LED indicator to better notify the user if a barcode was scanned and to show if the 
	hardware is ready to begin scanning. We are also planning on building a small enclosure to house all the hardware and create 
	a mount for the scanner and another mount in which we can place the barcode/QR code.  I was also considering a small speaker 
	to peep every time the barcode is read and recorded but that is just a bonus addition which will be considered later in the 
	future. Also looking to see if I can find a cheap laser scanner that we can use as a group to scan specifically barcodes 
	because I believe that would be a lot quicker and more efficient on the hardware. So far I based on the project schedule,
	we are on track to complete the project by week 14. My financial status up to this point has not changed but considering 
	the additional hardware we are looking to add, it may change next week.

	Week 7: All parts have been put together. PCB has been soldered and tested for shorts and no problems were found, 
	I did have issues with my raspberry pi software. I had to reinstall the OS and after which everything is working fine. 
	I have also got my webcam identifying barcodes and is able to scan them but it is not as accurate as I had hoped for and 
	I am testing other methods of input.
<ul>Week 8: Project Placard.</ul>
	Week 9: 30 Second video clip made. 
	Week 10: Project Demonstration/Progress Report was due today. I demonstrated my project but as previously predicted the webcam had 
	some trouble in focusing on the barcodes and reading them. In the end however it was able to read and display barcodes to the terminal. 
	After taking a lot of feedback from my teammates and peers in class, I am considering the possibility of using a laser barcode reader to scan barcodes instead but also have the webcam available for QR codes as well.

	Week 5: All parts have been ordered and final team meeting has been done. All aspects of project have been finalized.
	So far the project is on schedule with all the parts ordered and a good understanding of how everything will work together. 
	The first week was spent organizing and getting into teams. Week 2 was spent putting together a project proposal that describes what 
	our team is looking to design and the minimal budget associated with the project. Week 3 we had a full descripted project schedule. 
	Week 4 the budget report for all parts was listed. Week 5 we had acquired all parts and assembled them together.
	I have not faced any issues or problems so far and everything is coming along very well as described in our project schedule and project budget.
	Financial status is at a good standing with all parts purchased we do not need to purchase any thing else.
